## Open Source
The Zephyr Workbench extension is a fully open-source project, built to provide an IDE for the Zephyr community and to help and to introduce Zephyr to newcomers. It is designed to enhance your development experience by providing tools and features that are easy to use. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ac6Embedded/vscode-zephyr-workbench), and we actively encourage developers to contribute, review, and improve the project. By sharing the code openly, we aim to continously evolve the tool with collaboration, transparency, and a users/developers feedback.

## Contribute
We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your efforts help make this extension better for everyone. Here's how you can get involved:

- Reporting Issues: Found a bug or have a feature request? Please check existing issues and, if needed, open a new one to let us know.
- Improving Documentation: Clear documentation is crucial for user experience. If you spot something unclear or missing, feel free to suggest improvements!

## Roadmap
Zephyr Workbench development is driven by community-feedback and we planned to release new features as quickly as possible.

- Short-Term goals:
  - Online tutorials and user guide

  - Support West build environment variables (OVERLAYS, ROOT directories)
  - Better support of west workspace topology

- Long-Term goals:
  - Support Application types (repository, workspace, freestanding)
