# Known Issues

This section lists some of the common issues encountered when using Zephyr Workbench, along with possible solutions and workarounds.

---

## Conflict with STM32 VS Code Extension

When the **STM32Cube for Visual Studio Code** is installed alongside Zephyr Workbench, it can cause conflicts that break the build process.  
You may see errors such as:

```
ERROR: it looks like . is a build directory: did you mean --build-dir . instead?
FATAL ERROR: refusing to proceed without --force due to above error
```

This issue typically occurs because both extensions attempt to manage CMake build directories.

### Workarounds

- **Disable or uninstall** the STM32 VS Code extension.  
- Alternatively, install **Zephyr Workbench** in a [standalone portable VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable).

- Remove any files previously generated by the STM32 extension:
  - `CMakeFiles/`
  - `CMakeCache.txt`

## PowerShell 7 as Default Terminal

Another reported issue occurs when **PowerShell 7** is configured as the default integrated terminal in VS Code.  
This can lead to errors when running build or flash tasks.

### Workarounds

- Uninstall **PowerShell 7** if not required.  
- Or, in VS Code, change the [default terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/profiles) to **Windows PowerShell** instead of PowerShell 7.

More details are available in [GitHub Issue #36](https://github.com/Ac6Embedded/vscode-zephyr-workbench/issues/36).

## Runner Not Found While Flashing

You may encounter an error such as:
```
-- west flash: using runner openocd
FATAL ERROR: required program openocd not found; install it or add its location to PATH
```
This happens when the flashing/debugging **runner** (e.g. `openocd`, `jlink`) is not installed or cannot be found in the system PATH.

### Workarounds
Add the runner to the global PATH
   - Ensure the folder containing the runner executable (e.g `openocd.exe` on Windows, `openocd` on Linux/macOS) is in your PATH.
